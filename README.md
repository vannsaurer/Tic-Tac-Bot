# Tic-Tac-Bot
A OpenCV Tic-Tac-Toe Game Bot
by 
Nicholas Aubé 
Virginia Saurer

Summary
	The main goals of this project are to create a program that can analyze an image. If it “sees” a tic-tac-toe board, it will represent the state of the 
	board in its internal memory, and resume the match against a human player. The computer agent will move in an intelligent fashion, denying the human if
	they are approaching a victory, instead of simply moving randomly.

Background
	This program will have many technical similarities to the recommended project “Sudoku Solver”. The main element of the project will be the object 
	recognition so that the system will be able to detect an empty of partially completed tic-tac-toe board, and recreate that internally so that the 
	game can be continued by the user and the bot seamlessly. There should be no additional iOS functions needed as this project is not intended to be
	run on mobile devices. Other areas of interest that are relevant to the computer vision components of the project are: real-time image processing 
	and object recognition, as well as a system to differentiate multiple different types of symbols from each other, such as lines from circles and crosses. 

Challenge
	The challenge of this project was chosen to be representative of the size and newness of the members to the field of computer vision. This project 
	combines multiple areas of computer vision with areas of artificial intelligence such as optimization, and decision trees. The basic runtime flow 
	of the project could look something resembling the following:


Goals & Deliverables
-image processing (photos and created images?)
-game bot
