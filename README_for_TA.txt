The initial goal of this project was to create a program that can analyze an image drawn by the user. 
The program is able to recognize shapes like a cross, or a circle. It takes this information and passes 
it into a secondary program that takes this information and plays a game of tic-tac-toe against the player.
 This secondary program will  represent the state of the board in its internal memory, and submit moves with 
the intelligence to know which ones are possible, and which spaces are already taken. If the player or the 
computer agent wins the game, or the game ends in a draw, the program will terminate and a message is displayed 
notifying the user of this.
The program was written in Python and used the OpenCV library.
